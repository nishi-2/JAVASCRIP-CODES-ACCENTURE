--- Arrays are generally described as "list-like objects"; they are basically single objects that contain multiple 
    values stored in a list.

--- In an array, we can store various data types — strings, numbers, objects, and even other arrays. 
--- We can also mix data types in a single array — we do not have to limit ourselves to storing only numbers 
    in one array, and in another only strings. For ex, let random = ['tree', 795, [0, 1, 2]];
--- An array inside an array is called a multidimensional array. You can access an item inside an array that is 
    itself inside another array by chaining two sets of square brackets together. For ex, random[2][2];

--- Value modification or reassignment in the array is applicable.
--- To find the length of an array, that is the number of elements in the array - array.length is used.

--- Conversion between the strings and arrays.
    -- To convert a string into an array - .split() method is used along with the separator.
        Syntax - string.split(separator)
    -- To convert an array into a string - .join() method is used.
        Syntax -  string.join(separator)
    -- To convert an array to a string, there is another method - toString() method.
       This method is not taking any argument and will always create a comma-separated string from the array.

--- Adding and deleting element in an array -
    -- Operation at the end of an array -
        -- To add an element at the end of an array - array.push(ele1,ele2,..)
        -- To get an element from the end of an array - array.pop()
    -- Operation at the beginning of an array -
        -- To add an element at the front of an array - array.unshift(ele1,ele2,..)
        -- To remove an element from the front of an array - array.shift()
