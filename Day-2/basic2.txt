--- Variables are basically containers for values (such as numbers, or strings of text). 
--- Variable is created with the keyword let (or var) followed by a name for your variable.
--- Constants are used to store values that are immutable or can't be changed and are created with the keyword const.

--- Events in JS - Events are things that happen in the browser — a button being clicked, a page loading, a video playing, etc. 
    — in response to which we can run blocks of code. The constructs that listen out for the event happening are called event listeners, 
    and the blocks of code that run in response to the event firing are called event handlers.

--- the focus() method to automatically put the text cursor into the <input> text field as soon as the page loads, meaning that the user 
    can start typing their first guess right away, without having to click the form field first.
