--- JavaScript only has one data type for numbers, both integers and decimals â€” Number.
    This means that whatever type of numbers you are dealing with in JavaScript, you handle them in exactly the same way.

--- typeof operator in JS is used to check the data type of the value stored in the variable.

--- The Number object, an instance of which represents all standard numbers you'll use in your JavaScript, 
    has a number of useful methods available on it for you to manipulate numbers.
            -- To round number to a fixed number of decimal places, toFixed() method is used.
            -- To convert a string into a number, Number() constructor is used. This is generally needed for working on
               with the forms where the input data is in the string format.
